DATA SCIENCE TASK 2:
Building a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using data science techniques in Python involves several steps, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. In this project, we'll explore the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers such as their age, gender, class, fare, and whether they survived or not. Our goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the survival of passengers based on these features.

Introduction:
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. The dataset we'll be working with contains information about the passengers onboard, including whether they survived or not. By analyzing this data and building a predictive model, we aim to gain insights into factors that influenced survival rates and create a model that can predict the likelihood of survival for future passengers.

Data Exploration:
We'll start by loading the Titanic dataset and exploring its structure. This includes examining the features available, their data types, and the presence of missing values. We'll also visualize the distributions of features and explore correlations between them to understand their relationships with survival.

Data Preprocessing:
Before training our predictive model, we need to preprocess the data. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features if necessary. We'll also split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Model Selection and Training:
Next, we'll choose appropriate classification algorithms for our predictive model. Common choices include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. We'll train multiple models using the training data and optimize their hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation and grid search.

Model Evaluation:
Once we've trained our models, we'll evaluate their performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. This step is crucial for assessing how well our model generalizes to unseen data and identifying the best-performing model.

Results Analysis:
After evaluating the models, we'll analyze the importance of features in predicting survival. This analysis will help us understand which factors played a significant role in determining the likelihood of survival for passengers. We'll also visualize the model's decision boundaries or feature importances to gain further insights.
